            <p>
                Httpster is a showcase of damn fine website design,
                lovingly curated and categorised so we can perv on it at our whim. We love good typography, and
                effective, unpretentious design; in short, simple ideas executed perfectly. While we aim to
                showcase excellent development as well, we apologise in advance for including poorly coded stuff
                if it just looks so damn good.
            </p>

            <h2>Established 2012</h2>
            <p>
                Httpster’s first iteration was built back in 2012 when I, Dom (<a
                href="https://twitter.com/DominicWhittle/">@dominicwhittle</a>), shared a studio with Tom (<a
                href="https://mobile.twitter.com/guvnor_co/">@guvnor</a>). We would email links of nice sites to each
                other but we’d lose track of them. Pretty quickly we realised we’d need a better system for sharing and
                tagging the stuff we get inspired by. I built a quick site in a weekend and threw it online. It's now 10
                years later and we're in the forth iteration of the site.

            <h2>How do I pronounce “Httpster”?</h2>
            <p>
                I don't know. I just sort of mumble “hipster” and then change the subject to my favourite beard oil,
                vegan food joints, and alternate life choices. Vaccinate your kids, for fuck’s sake.

            <h2>Who drew the sick logotype?</h2>
            <p>
                I know, right. That was the amazing <a href="http://jesscruickshank.com/?ref=httpster.net">Jess
                Cruikshank</a>. Super rad.
